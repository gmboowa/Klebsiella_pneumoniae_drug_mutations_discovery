# Klebsiella pneumoniae SNP calling & drug resistance annotation pipeline

This pipeline is a bash script that automates quality control, variant calling, and drug resistance gene annotation for *Klebsiella pneumoniae* whole-genome sequencing data. It leverages tools such as **FastQC**, **MultiQC**, and **Snippy** to perform SNP calling and identify mutations associated with antibiotic resistance.

---

## Features

- Performs **quality checks** using FastQC
- Generates **combined quality reports** using MultiQC
- Calls **SNPs** using Snippy with a reference genome
- Detects and annotates **drug resistance mutations**
- Outputs **drug-specific resistance summaries** per sample

---

## Input requirements

1. A `list.txt` file with one sample name per line (without file extensions).
2. Paired-end FASTQ files for each sample named as:
   - `sample_1.fastq.gz`
   - `sample_2.fastq.gz`
     
3. A GenBank reference file for *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (update the path in the script).

---

## How to run

1. Make the script executable:
   
```bash
chmod +x klebsiella_pipeline.sh
```

2. Run the script from within your working directory:
   
```bash
./klebsiella_pipeline.sh
```

Ensure the script is located in the same directory as your FASTQ files and `list.txt`.

---

## Output files

For each sample, the script generates:

- `sample.snps/` directory containing SNP calling output
- `sample.Drug-Resistance-Details.txt`: Detected resistance mutations
- Drug-specific summaries such as:
  - `sample.Aminoglycoside.Resistance.txt`
  - `sample.Beta-lactam.Resistance.txt`
  - `sample.Fluoroquinolone.Resistance.txt`, etc.

Empty files are automatically removed to declutter the output.
